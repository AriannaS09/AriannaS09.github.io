<h1>Amazing Animals of the World</h1>
<p> By: Arianna Sukhdeo         <p>Date:7/22/20</p>
 
  <div id="introduction">
    <h3>Black and White Pandas</h3>
    <p>The black and white panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) is a bear native to south central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. <strong>Its conservation status is currently very low (due to it's species being endangered).</strong>
  <br /><br />
      Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. 
      Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food. 
      Besides their cultural significance, these animals are widely considered one of the most adorable and charming creatures 
  on the planet.</p>

    <h3>Black rhinoceros</h3>
    <p>The black rhinoceros, or hook-lipped rhinoceros is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern and southern Africa
      including Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. </p>
    <p>Black rhinoceroses communicate their territory with other animals by scent marking, grunting, and snorting. The two horns of the black rhinoceros are made entirely of hardened hair. Rhinos canâ€™t see very well, and anything farther than 35 feet away from the rhino appears blurry.
      To make up for this poor eyesight, rhinos have an excellent sense of hearing. This animal is an endangered species because of poaching. 
      Rhino horns are used for dagger handles and traditional medicines, although there is no scientific evidence that the horn has any medicinal powers. So please, if the rhinos don't harm
    you, don't harm them.</p>

  <div id="Masai Giraffe">
    <h3>Masai Giraffe</h3>
    <p>The Masai giraffe, also spelled Maasai giraffe, also called Kilimanjaro giraffe, is the largest subspecies of giraffe. It is native to East Africa. The Masai giraffe can be found in central and southern Kenya and in Tanzania. 
      It has distinctive, irregular, jagged, star-like blotches that extend to the hooves. A median forehead lump is usually present in bulls. 
    A Few Interesting Facts:
    A giraffe may eat up to 75 pounds of food per day. Giraffes spend most of their day eating because they only get a few leaves in each bite. Their favorite leaves are acacia trees. Despite the fact that the acacia trees have long thorns, the giraffes use their 18-to-20-inch tongue to reach around the thorns.
      When giraffes are not eating, they chew their cud. Acacia leaves contain a lot of water, so giraffes can go long periods of time without having to get a drink of water. 
      Giraffes are very vulnerable when they are drinking because they have to bend a long way down to drink. Giraffes can drink up to 10 gallons of water a day.</p>

    <h3>Quick Facts on the African Lion</h3>
    <p>
Male lions grow to be 9 to 10 feet long and can weigh up to 500 pounds. Females grow to be seven to 8 feet long and weigh between 270 and 350 pounds.

 The average lifespan of the African Lion in the wild is 15 to 18 years, and 25 to 30 years in human care.

 The African lion has a golden tan coat that blends well with the Savanna and grassland surroundings in
 Central and Southern Africa.

 These felines live in the savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest.</p>

  <div id="Polar Bears">
    <h3>Polar Bears</h3>
   <p>Polar bears are the worldâ€™s largest land predators. They feed mainly on ringed seals and bearded seals. 
     They use their large front paws for hunting seals. When the seal comes up for air, the polar bear kills it and flips it out of the water with a single blow of its paw.
     When no marine food is available, they feed on vegetation, but this is not their ideal diet. Polar bears have up to four inches of blubber to help keep them warm. Their fur actually has a hollow core and is transparent. Polar bear skin is black, which helps it to absorb 
     warmth from the sun in their cold native range.Polar bears are recognized as vulnerable by the IUCN. They are threatened by global warming and the corresponding lack of sea ice which allows them to hunt. 
     They are also threatened by illegal hunting, chemically contaminated prey, and humans taking over their land. Help protect polar bears!</p>

      <div id="Komodo Dragon">
    <h3>Komodo Dragon</h3>
    <p>The Komodo dragon, also known as the Komodo monitor or Varanus komodoensis, is a species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. A member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae, it is the largest extant species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms. Adult males average 8.5 feet long and weigh between 175 and 200 pounds. Adult females average 7.5 feet long and weigh between 150 and 160 pounds. However, there have been cases of Komodo dragons growing over 10 feet long and weighing 300 pounds.
The average lifespan of the Komodo dragon in the wild is 30 or more years.The Komodo dragon preys on pigs, goats, deer, young buffalo, and even horses. Young Komodo dragons eat rats, mice, and birds. Indonesia, in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Rinca, Komodo, Flores, and the smaller islands of Gili, Montang, and Padar.
Komodo dragons live in the tropical savanna forests, but range widely over the islands from beach to ridge top.</p>

    <h3>Chimpanzees</h3>
   <strong>I would just like to take some time to say please help save the chimpanzees!!</strong> <p>Us humans share approximately 98% of our DNA with chimps, so itâ€™s fair to say that we are 98% chimpanzee, and chimps are 98% human. Chimpanzees are an endangered species. Millions of chimpanzees used to live throughout equatorial Africa from southern Senegal through Central Africa to western Tanzania. This is an area almost the size of the United States. Today, there are estimated to be merely 170,000-300,000 chimpanzees left in Africa, and their population is decreasing rapidly. One recent census in the Ivory Coast revealed that the chimp population there had decreased 90% in just the past twenty years.</p>
<p>The primary threats to chimpanzees are habitat destruction, hunting, and disease. The increasing human population is encroaching ever deeper into even protected areas of chimpanzee habitats, and large scale logging is now a major threat to the forest primates of Africa. Subsistence hunting of chimpanzees as a source of meat is nothing new, but there is now a thriving but unsustainable commercial market for bushmeat (the meat of wild animals), including chimpanzees. Increased contact with humans, both local people and eco-tourists, has also brought the threat of diseases which may be mild in humans but lethal to chimps.<p>
    <strong>Some Facts About Chimps:</strong>
Chimpanzees are fascinating beings. Our list of chimp facts contains information about chimpanzee social behavior and natural habitat, along with facts about chimpanzee protection efforts. Find out the similarities and differences between chimpanzees and humans, with primate facts and trivia.

Chimpanzees are fascinating beings. Our list of chimp facts contains information about chimpanzee social behavior and natural habitat, along with facts about chimpanzee protection efforts. Find out the similarities and differences between chimpanzees and humans, with primate facts and trivia.

Chimpanzees are our closest living relative because we share all but 1.4% of our DNA with chimps. Chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than to gorillas or orangutans.
In the wild, chimpanzees live in large groups of 15 to 120 individuals. They communicate with one another through a complex, subtle system of vocalizations, facial expressions, body postures, and gestures.
Like human infants, newborn chimpanzees are entirely dependent on their mothers for warmth, protection, transportation, and nourishment.
In their natural habitat, chimpanzees nurse for 5 years. During this time, they learn what to eat and what to avoid by watching their mothers and other adult chimpanzees.
Chimpanzees begin wandering short distances from their mothers at about 8 months of age.
Chimpanzees enter adulthood at about 13 years of age. Chimpanzee mothers may enjoy life-long bonds with their adult sons and daughters.
Chimpanzees, like humans, use facial expressions to convey emotions.
Chimpanzees have emotions similar to those we call joy, anger, grief, sorrow, pleasure, boredom, and depression. 
Even though chimpanzeesâ€™ habitat is often near water, chimps cannot swim, due to the structure and density of their bodies.
A chimpanzeeâ€™s senses of sight, taste, and hearing are similar to those of humans.
Chimpanzees can live for more than 50 years. This is another reason why chimps who were purchased as pets often end up at sanctuaries.</p>
