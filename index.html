  <h1>Amazing Animals of the World</h1>
  <div id="introduction">
    <h2>Black and White Pandas</h2>
    <p>The black and white panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) is a bear native to south central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Its conservation status is currently <strong>Very Low</strong>.<br /><br />. 
      Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. 
      Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food. 
      Besides their cultural significance, these animals are widely considered one of the most adorable and charming creatures on the planet.</p>
    <h3>Black rhinoceros</h3>
    <h3>The black rhinoceros or hook-lipped rhinoceros is a species of rhinoceros, native to eastern and southern Africa
      including Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. </h3>
    <p>Black rhinoceroses communicate their territory with other animals by scent marking, grunting, and snorting. The two horns of the black rhinoceros are made entirely of hardened hair. Rhinos can’t see very well, and anything farther than 35 feet away from the rhino appears blurry.
      To make up for this poor eyesight, rhinos have an excellent sense of hearing. This animal is an endangered species because of poaching. 
      Rhino horns are used for dagger handles and traditional medicines, although there is no scientific evidence that the horn has any medicinal powers. So please, if the rhinos don't harm
    you, don't harm them.</p>

  <div id="Masai Giraffe">
    <h2>Masai Giraffe</h2>
    <h3>The Masai giraffe, also spelled Maasai giraffe, also called Kilimanjaro giraffe, is the largest subspecies of giraffe. It is native to East Africa. The Masai giraffe can be found in central and southern Kenya and in Tanzania. 
      It has distinctive, irregular, jagged, star-like blotches that extend to the hooves. A median forehead lump is usually present in bulls. 
    A Few Interesting Facts:
    A giraffe may eat up to 75 pounds of food per day. Giraffes spend most of their day eating because they only get a few leaves in each bite. Their favorite leaves are acacia trees. Despite the fact that the acacia trees have long thorns, the giraffes use their 18-to-20-inch tongue to reach around the thorns.
      When giraffes are not eating, they chew their cud. Acacia leaves contain a lot of water, so giraffes can go long periods of time without having to get a drink of water. 
      Giraffes are very vulnerable when they are drinking because they have to bend a long way down to drink. Giraffes can drink up to 10 gallons of water a day.</h3>

  <div id="Polar Bears">
    <h2>Polar Bears</h2>
   <p>Polar bears are the world’s largest land predators. They feed mainly on ringed seals and bearded seals. 
     They use their large front paws for hunting seals. When the seal comes up for air, the polar bear kills it and flips it out of the water with a single blow of its paw.
     When no marine food is available, they feed on vegetation, but this is not their ideal diet. Polar bears have up to four inches of blubber to help keep them warm. Their fur actually has a hollow core and is transparent. Polar bear skin is black, which helps it to absorb 
     warmth from the sun in their cold native range.Polar bears are recognized as vulnerable by the IUCN. They are threatened by global warming and the corresponding lack of sea ice which allows them to hunt. 
     They are also threatened by illegal hunting, chemically contaminated prey, and humans taking over their land. Help protect polar bears!</p>
